            <h1>What is API?</h1>
            <p>Application Programme Interface.</p>
            <p>Application Programme Interface abbreviated as API which is a software intermediary that allows two
                applications to talk to each other.</p>
            <p>Let's look
                into an example to go through with this topic,</p>
            <p>1.If user wants to book train tickets, web application shows the departure time, stations like that all
                the informations.</p>
            <p>2.When we look in this from the developer side, developer wants to display all the train schedule
                informations in the web application, then developer use the APis to get these train informations from
                the web server where all the train details and informations are stored.</p>
            <p>3.Then developers can retrieve data from the web server using the APis to display in the web application.

            <h1>Benefits Of Using API</h1>
            <!-- <img alt="image not found" src="../assets/images/home/html-struc.PNG"> -->
            <p id="explanation">APis needed to make the connection between application functions to handle the data from
                predefined processes.</p>
            <h2>Ease of integration:</h2>
            <p>APis can be embedded with any type of software application, So it can easily integrate with the
                applications and functions between different websites</p>
            <h2 id="attribute">Reduce software development effort:</h2>
            <p>Using APis reduce development efforts, developers can implement APis of Google Maps to provide the exact
                store location to website visitors.</p>
            <h2>Security:</h2>
            <p>APis provide a secure communication gateway for different app components to interact and exchange data.
            </p>
            <h1>How it works?</h1>
            <p>1.So, an application sends data to a server.<br>
                2.The server retrieves the data and interprets it. <br>
                3.Some action is performed on the data.<br>
                4.The server sends the information back to the application.<br>
                5.The application interprets the data.<br>
                6.The application presents the interpreted information in a readable way.</p>

            <p>The communication between the application and the server is all done via API.</p>
            <p>The exchange of data is mostly done using JSON.</p>

            <h3>HTTP REQUESTS:</h3>
            <p>HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web that
                defines how messages are formatted and transmitted.</p>
            <p>HTTP is a stateless protocol. </p>
            <p>This means that the server does not require to maintain information or
                status about every user for the duration of multiple requests.</p>
            <p>This also means that the server does not
                need to maintain a continuous connection with the client.</p>
            <h3>Types of HTTP request:</h3>
            <p>► GET - requests for a data<br></p>

            <p>► POST - submits data causing a change in state on the server<br></p>

            <p>► PUT - replaces the specified data with request data<br></p>

            <p>► DELETE - deletes the specified data<br></p>

            <p>► HEAD - requests for data but without the response body<br></p>

            <p>► CONNECT - establishes a tunnel to the server<br></p>

            <p>► OPTIONS - describes the communication options for the target data<br></p>

            <p>► TRACE - perform message loop-back test along the path to the target data<br></p>

            <p>► PATCH - apply partial changes to data</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>There are several ways to get the data from an API.</p>
            <h1>AJAX:</h1>
            <p>
                *AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.<br>
                *It is about updating a web page without reloading the entire web page.<br>
                *This is very useful when only some parts of a web page need to be changed.</p>
            <p>Before learning about asynchronous, let us see what is the meaning of synchronous calls</p>
            <h3>Synchronous Call</h3>
            <p>If a synchronous call happens then any further operation on the client gets blocked, i.e. any further
                execution of operations stop executing until a response is not received. Like in JavaScript or other
                languages, the statements execute in a sequence.</p>
            <h3>Asynchronous Call</h3>
            <p>Asynchronous means that the operations on the client do not get blocked. This means, that the client can
                work on other things and does not need to wait for the response. Examples of asynchronous calls in
                JavaScript are - setTimeout(), setlnterval(), etc.</p>

            <p>AJAX is not a programming or a scripting language. It is a group of inter-related technologies

                like JavaScript, XML, HTML, CSS, and DOM</p>
            <h3>Benifits of AJAX:</h3>
            <p> • Update a web page without reloading the page<br></p>

            <p>• Receive and send data asynchronously<br></p>

            <p>• Send only important data to the server<br></p>

            <p>• Makes the application faster<br></p>
            <h3>AJAX Request</h3>
            <p>AJAX communicates asynchronously with the server using the XMLHttpRequest object.</p>
            <p>To send an HTTP request, create an XMLHttpRequest object, open a URL, and send the request.

                The code below shows an example of AJAX request-</p>
            <code>let xhrReq = new XMLHttpRequest();<br>

                xhrReq.onload = function() {<br>
                
                  let resJS0N =JSON.parse(xhrReq.response); <br>
                  console.log(resJS0N);<br>
                  
                  } ;<br>
                  
                  xhrReq.open("get", url, true); <br>
                  xhrReq.send();
                </code><br>

            <p>The open() method initializes a newly-created request.<br>

                It has the following syntax - XMLHttpRequest. open (method, url, async, user, password)<br>

                The parameters other than 'method' and 'url' are optional but has to be in the sequence as shown in the
                syntax above.<br>

                The 'async' option is a boolean parameter defining asynchronous request when true (by default is true)
                or synchronous request when it is false.<br>
                onload() function process the response what we receive<br>

                The 'response' property returns the response body content. The 'send()' method sends the request to the
                server.<br>

                The syntax is - XMLHttpRequest. send (body)<br>

                The 'body' is an optional parameter which is ignored when the request method is 'GET' or 'HEAD'.<br>

                The constructor function XMLHttpRequest isn't limited to only XML documents.<br>
                It starts with 'XML'
                because when it was created the main format that was originally used for Asynchronous Data Exchange was
                XML, but now JSON is mostly used.</p>

            <a><button data-id="ajax-1">Try it in Code Editor</button></a>

            <h3>AJAX REQUEST USING JQUERY</h3>
            <p>Writing AJAX code can be a bit tricky because different browsers have different syntax for AJAX
                implementation.<br>
                However, using jQuery you can use AJAX functionality with only few lines of code.</p>
            <p>The jQuery 'ajax()' method sends asynchronous HTTP requests to the server.</p>
            <h3>Syntax for Jquery ajax:</h3>
            <code>$.ajax({<br>

                    url: 'example.json',<br>
                     method: 'GET',<br>
                    success: function(data){{<br>
                      console.log(data);<br>
                    }}<br>
                  
                  }) ;</code>
            <p>
              url - a string containing the URL to which the request is sent.<br>
                 The 'url' can be provided as seen in the
                syntax or there is also a url property in 'settings' as seen in the example.<br>
                method - the HTTP method to use for the request (e.g. "POST", "GET", "PUT"). <br>
                data - data to be sent to the server. <br>
                It can be JSON object, string or array.<br>
                success - a callback function to be executed when
                Ajax request succeeds.
            </p>
