            <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
            <p>Hyper Text MarkUp Language.</p>
            <p>It is just like human skeleton and css is just like skin to look good and js is brain</p>
            <p>It will decide what to display from top to bottom and left to right on your webpage.</p>
            <p>Hypertext refers to the way in which Webpages (HTML documents) are linked together.
                Thus the link available on a webpage are called Hypertext.
                As its name suggests,HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark up" a text
                document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.</p>

            <h1>Structure of HTML page</h1>
            <img src="../assets/images/home/html-struc.PNG">
            <h2 id="explanation">Explanation:</h2>
            <p> !DOCTYPE html -> defines that this document is an HTML5 document<br>
                html-> is the root element of the HTML page<br>
                head-> element contain the meta information about the HTML page<br>
                title ,/title -> specifies a title for the HTML page<br>
                body-> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as
                headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.<br>
                HTML is not a programming language, it is a markup language which is used for describing webpages, A
                markup language is a set of markup tags, and HTML uses these markup tags to give elements to the web
            HTML tags are always surrounded by angle brackets(<>)<br>
                    some tags require a closing tag as well some are self-closing tags, they do not require any
                    closing tags for them. Examples of tags which needs a closing tag are HTML ,/HTML or BODY /BODY,
                    they always come in pair, the first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is end tag.<br>
                    Examples of tags which have closing tags with them are br,img or b tag etc. Start and end tags are
                    also called opening tags and closing tags. </p>
            <h1 id="attribute">Attributes</h1>
            <p>HTML elements can have added attributes as well, they
                provide additional information about the element.<br>
                Attributes are always specified in the start tag itself.<br>
                Attributes come in name/value pairs like: name=”value”.<br>
                Attribute values should always be enclosed in quotes.<br>
                Double style quotes are the most common, but single style quotes are also allowed.</p>
            <p>
                EXAMPLE: -<br>

                HTML links are defined with the a tag.<br>

                    The link address is provided as an attribute href:<br>

                    <p>Most of the times we want to have some characters displayed as it is on the web page but they get
                    different meaning when we write them in code or sometimes, they get ignored as well. To solve this
                    problem HTML includes some special entities which makes it easier to display character</p><br>
