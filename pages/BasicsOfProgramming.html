            <h1>What is Programming?</h1>
            <p>Programming is nothing but teaching Computer to do something.
                 If we have not been taught to do a specific task with some conditions so far, then you have to say in a way that computer understands.(It understand only 1's and 0's).<br>
                 That's where Programming language comes into picture.</p>
            <p>Let's take an real time example: If you see a car moving then you can imagine that the wheels have provided an incrementing loop(repeating the same thing) and break will be the condition to stop the car.</p>
            <p>Basically, Programming is used to make our work easier.</p>
            <h2>Why Programming?</h2>
            <p>Nowadays , Programming is everywhere.
                <ul>
                <li>Calculator</li>
                <li>Washing machine</li>
                <li>ATM</li>
                <li>Car</li>
                <li>Bike</li>
            </ul>
                and so on.
            </p>
            <p>Without Programming, you won't read this article :) or even a simple text editor to begin with.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="scratch">
            <h1>Let's start from scratch.</h1>
            <p>Yes!!.You heard it right ?.Let's begin with scratch.<a style="color: black" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Check this</a>(It is a best way to learn programming with help of anime)</p>
            <p>We are not going to use any Programming language here. But We are going to help you to build a strong foundation on your logical thinking.</p>

        <p><span>Task-1:</span>Make your cat to get and say your name for 3 seconds.</p>
        <p>Hope you tried it!!.</p>
        <h4>Solution:</h4>
        <p>Step 1:Drag & drop "when green clicked" from events tab.<br>
           Step 2:Get name from the user.<br>
           Step 3:Store it in a default variable called answer.And say it for 3 seconds.<br> 
        </p>
        <h4>These steps are called algorithms.
            So, Basically the algorithms is a set of procedures that follows to acheive the action.

       <img alt="image not found" src="../assets/images/TYS/scratch-concat.PNG" height="480px" width="800px">
       <p>In actual programming , The join operator is called concat(Which helps to join (or) merge the strings).</p>

        <h3>Task-2:Make a program to add two numbers by your cat.</h3>
        <p>Hope you tried it!!.</p>
        <h4>Solution:</h4>
        <p>Step 1:Drag & drop "when green clicked" from events tab.<br>
            Step 2:Create a variables to store number1 and number2<br> 
            Step 3:Get two numbers from the user<br>
            Step 4:Store it in a default variable called answer.And say the sum of the numbers.<br> 
         </p>
         <img alt="image not found" src="../assets/images/TYS/scratch-variable.PNG" height="480px" width="800px">
         <p>click "make a variable" tab to create a new variable.</p>
         <img alt="image not found" src="../assets/images/TYS/scratch-add.PNG" height="480px" width="800px">
         <p>Here, You may wonder why I used Set function(set is actually used to assign the value for a variable, I set the number1=answer(what we got from the user)).<br>
            And at the last block , I mentioned set number1 and number2 as '0' because I want to make it as '0' once i got the sum of numbers.So that, the number cannot overlap from the previous inputs.<br>

            <h3>Task-4:Let's imagine your teacher is asking you to write the program to know the grade of the students with the help of total marks out of 500.</h3>
            <p>We are going to use 'If conditions' and loop here. Because Every student secured different marks .So, grades also vary according to their mark.<br>
                'Loop' is to calculate every student grades frequently without the break.So that, We can calculate it within the short period of time.<br> 
            </p>
            <h3>Conditions:</h3>
            <p>*If a student scored more than 450 , then he/she should get 'A' grade<br>
                *If a student scored between 350 to 450 , then he/she should get 'B' grade<br>
                *If a student scored between 300 to 350 , then he/she should get 'C' grade<br>
                *For other scores you have to say 'arrear'.

            <h4>Real time examples:</h4>
            <p>If it is raining outside, then don't have to water to plants by yourself.<br>
               So,you can tell :if it is raining,I shall not water the plants,else I have to water them.<br>
               You can write the pseudo code as below: Pseudo code--->Pseudo code, as the name suggests, is a false code or a representation of code which can be understood by even a normal man with some school level programming knowledge.<br>
                 if (raining==true)<br>
                      do not water<br>
