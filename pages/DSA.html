            <h1>What is Algorithm?</h1>
            <p>Let's say you have to Prepare noodles recipe</p>
            <h2>What will you do?</h2>
            <h3>Steps to follow:</h3>
            <p>1.Water to boil<br>
                2.Add masala<br>
                3.Add noodles<br>
                4.Serve your noodles recipe<br>
                These steps are called algorithms.

            <h2>Linked list</h2>
            <p>let us consider you are going to a movie with your friends(say 20 members).After you buy your tickets you
                notice none of the seats are contiguous.<br>

                But you feel you want to stay in touch with everyone in between the show time.(let's say during the songs).<br>

                But this is not easy since remembering everyone’s seat number is difficult.<br> So what would you do is,you
                would remember only one friend’s seat number and contact him , and he in turn remembers another’s and so
                on and the last one need not to remember any information(singly linked list) or the last person may
                remember first one’s(circular list).<br>

                In data structures,this concept is implemented using pointers/references.<br>
                Each node refers to some other
                node located at different address.</p>
