            <h1>Boolean</h1>
            <p>At its most basic level, a computer is a series of on and off switches, a set of 0s and 1s that flip back
                and flip in.</p>
            <p>The concept of using binary values to represent information (0 and 1, true and false) is so fundamental
                along with most other programming languages,it also has a dedicated type to
                these values, referred to as a boolean.</p>
            <h1>Creating a boolean value</h1>
            <p>Boolean values can be created by assigning a value of <span>true</span> or <span>false</span> to a
                variable.</p>

            <p>
                <span>
                    var bool1 = true;<br>
                    var bool2 = false;
                </span>
            </p>
            <h1>Booleans from comparison operators</h1>
            <p>
                Boolean values can also be created by using comparison operators, such as:
            </p>
            <p>
                * Greater Than - <span>></span><br>
                * Less Than - <span>
                    << /span><br>
                        * Greater Than or Equal To - <span>>=</span><br>
                        * Less Than or Equal To - <span>
                            <=< /span><br>
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/images/JavaScript/bool.PNG" alt="image not found" width="900px">
        </div>
        <div id="undefined">
            <h1>Undefined and Null values</h1>
            <p>
                When you declare a variable, its value is initialized to whatever value you assign by using the
                <span>=</span> sign.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following code snippet will initialize the variable as <span>pi</span> a number.
            </p>
            <p>var pi = 3.14159265359;</p>
            <p>But what if we created a variable that didn’t assign any value,like this</p>
            <p><span>var declareVariable;</span><br>
                In this case, we will get declareVariable with an <span>undefined value</span>.<br>
                This means you have not assigned an value to the variable.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/images/JavaScript/undefined.PNG" alt="image not found" width="900px">
            <h1 id="null">Null values</h1>
            <p>Variables with a <span>null type</span>, on the other hand, represent values that are intentionally
                empty. A <span>null variable</span> can be created by setting the variable equal to <span>null</span>.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div id="difference">
            <h1>What’s the difference between undefined and null?</h1>
            <p>Variables are only stored as <span>undefined</span> if they have been declared but not initialized with a
                value.</p>
            <p><span>Null values</span> intentionally are stored as null to indicate that the variable is empty. You
                should set a variable equal to null and only if the variable is expected to have no value.</p>
            <p>If this isn’t making sense right now, it’s ok.<br>
                We will continue to touch on this concept in following explanation.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="function">
            <h1>Functions:</h1>
            <p>Now you have an understanding of the basic data types and operations, we should try to make our
                programs a little more interesting. We will do this by manipulating the way in which the Javascript
                program
                executes. One way we can accomplish this is through the use of functions.</p>
            <p>Functions allow us to repeat tasks that involve a similar sequence of steps. You’ve already seen the
                console.log() function, which allows us to predictably log some output to the console.</p>

            <p>Let’s look at an example of a function definition that finds the sum of two numbers:</p>
            <p><span>var sum = function(x, y){<br>
                    return x + y;<br>
                    }</span></p>
            <p>We start by creating a variable,then define a function by using the <span>function(){}</span> syntax.</p>
            <p>Within the parentheses are a set of arguments, which are values that are used or manipulated by the
                function in some manner. If you have multiple arguments, they are each separated by a comma. A function
                can also have no arguments.</p>
            <p>The code to be executed by the function lies within the curly braces ({}). If you expect the function to
                give back some value, it should include a return statement (which is done by using the keyword return),
                followed by the value you want to be returned. If you don’t expect your Javascript function to return a
                value, you do not have to include a return statement.</p>
            <p><span>You may notice if you run the code above, nothing happens. In order to make use of our function, we
                    must invoke or call the function.</span></p>
            <p id="call-function">A function is <span>called</span> like below:</p>
            <p><span>functionName();</span></p>
            <p>The parentheses together, <span>()</span>, are an operator that initiates a function call. If you have
                arguments for the function to make use of, you must include those within the parenthesis.<br>
                Let’s make use of the <span>sum</span> function we just created:</p>
            <p><span>var onePlusTwo = sum(1, 2);<br>
                    var twoPlusTwenty = sum(2, 20);<br>

                    console.log(onePlusTwo, twoPlusTwenty);</span></p>
            <p>
                In this example, we make use of two different functions:<br>
                *the <span>sum()</span> function, where we pass <span>two numbers</span> as arguments<br>
                *the <span>console.log()</span> function, where we supply the <span>newly created variables</span> as
                arguments<br>
                In both cases where we use <span>sum()</span>, numbers are passed, so the value returned will also be a
                number. This
                number is then placed into the console using <span>console.log().</span>
            </p>
            <h1 id="why-function">Why are functions important?</h1>
            <p>The reason to use functions is that they allow us to <span>reuse code</span> and create modules to
                perform procedures we plan on using repeatedly. Though the example above isn’t much more useful than
                just using the <span>+</span> operator, but  you will see that functions are very useful as your code starts to get more
                complex.</p>
                <h1 id="task1">Task:1(Function)</h1>
                <p>Create a function named <span>Subtract</span> which allows values as two numbers and should return the result as number.</p>
